# Eagle_libraries
Few libraries I've created while working on PCB design. That may be helpful for people.

## 1) TG110-E050N5
SMD Single Port 10/100BASE-TX Transformer by HALO ( TG110-E050N5.lbr )

>> 2018/05/25 - Vivek -
This was my first experiment with Eagle library.
I didn't find it on internet and so created.
My purpose of using this pulse transformer was for isolation in isoSPI communication.

## 2) 1C201MZ4
100 VOLTS, 2.0 AMPS NPN LOW VCE(sat) TRANSISTOR by ON SEMICONDUCTOR ( 1C201MZ4.lbr )

>> 2018/07/17 - Vivek -
This is transistor I used to chop voltage to 5V from upto 75 V.
